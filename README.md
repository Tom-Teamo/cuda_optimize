# cuda_optimize

This is a repository for the project of the "High Performance Computing". The goal of the project is to optimize a given CUDA code.

It includes the following sub-projects:
* sgemm: A single precision matrix-matrix multiplication
* reduce: reduction of an array of floats
* reduce_nvidia: reduction of an array of floats from [nvidia samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples)
* wmma: C++ warp matrix operations
* flashAtten: A sample code for Flash Attention
* float4: A sample for float4 operations
